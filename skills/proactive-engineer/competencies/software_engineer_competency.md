---

## 7. Code Quality & Engineering Craft

**Expectation:** Produces production-grade code that others can confidently extend.

### Indicators

- Writes readable, well-structured, and well-tested code  
- Introduces abstractions only when justified  
- Proactively refactors legacy components  
- Maintains strong code review discipline  
- Leaves systems cleaner than they were found  

### Evidence of Strength

- Reduced tech debt in owned systems  
- Fewer defects escaping to production  
- Improved development velocity due to clearer structure  

---

## 8. Reliability & Operational Excellence

**Expectation:** Designs and maintains systems that function reliably in real-world conditions.

### Indicators

- Implements monitoring, logging, and alerting  
- Understands SLAs and SLOs  
- Conducts root cause analysis with rigor  
- Reduces repeat failure modes  
- Designs safe rollout and rollback mechanisms  

### Evidence of Strength

- Incident frequency decreases over time  
- Systems degrade gracefully under stress  
- Clear ownership and rapid recovery during outages  

---

## 9. Performance & Scalability

**Expectation:** Designs with efficiency and cost-awareness.

### Indicators

- Identifies CPU, memory, I/O, and network bottlenecks  
- Profiles systems under realistic load  
- Reduces latency and resource waste  
- Understands infrastructure cost drivers  
- Makes cost-performance tradeoffs explicit  

### Evidence of Strength
